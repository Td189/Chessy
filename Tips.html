            your chess game after getting past the fundamentals. I we will
            touch base on each of the core compenents of the game in order
            to develop an better understanding of whats actually happening

                <h1>Principals</h1>
                <h2>One of the most important aspects of Chess<h2>
            </header>
            <p>It can be difficult to achieve something when you aren't fully aware of the things holding you back.
                Principals in Chess play a key role in the decision making process of a match. Understanding them
                will
                allow you more clarity throughout the game while providing you the opportunity to play stronger
                moves,
                ultimately making you a stronger player. Lets go over these principles in order to significantly up
                your
                chess game!</p>

            <h2>01. Develop your pieces quickly.</h2>
            <p>Developing your pieces will allow your pieces more activity, in turn providing you more options for
                your
                game over your opponent, offensively and defensively.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>02. Control the center.</h2>
            <p>Controlling the center can allow for more control over the board in turn giving you more options
                through
                restricting your opponent's piece mobility while increasing your own.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>03. Try Maximizing Piece Activity</h2>
            <p>If possible, try placing pieces in places of the board which give pieces the most activity, this
                often
                being the center.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>04. Prioritize King safety</h2>
            <p>The King is the most <strong>important</strong> piece of the game, he ultimately decides who wins and
                loses the game, keep him protected.
            <h2>05. Do not neglect pieces</h2>
            Despite chess pieces having specific values, every piece is objectively important. Do not neglect pieces such as pawns because they have a low value. 
            Even hanging pawns can cost a player the game against the right opponent.
            <p>
            <h2>05. Try to develop your knights towards the center.</h2>
            <p>Placing Knights in the center of the board can provide strong activity on the board.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>06. A knight on the rim is dim.</h2>
            <p>While knights on the edge of the board aren’t always the end of the world, it is better to ensure
                that
                they are able to be placed on square that gives them more activity rather than the limiting edge.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>07. Don't take unnecessary chances / Don’t Play Hope Chess.</h2>
            <p>Always play chess based on the best possible move, if there is an unnecessary flaw or consequence to
                a
                plan, don't go through with it, it will most likely be punished.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>08. Play aggressive.</h2>
            <p>Constantly make threats at your opponent if possible, most importantly threats that come with
                secondary
                benefits such as developing or double attacks such as skewers, mates, and forks.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>09. Calculate forced moves first.</h2>
            <p>Now as neglected as it can be, especially in the opening, forced moves for you and your opponent
                should
                be prioritized over everything before making a move. Things such as checks, captures, and checkmates
                are
                all examples of forcing moves that you should consider before making moves.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>10. If you see a good move, look for a better one</h2>
            <p>Very often if you see find a good move in match there will usually be a better one due to your
                opponent
                being at an disadvantage, try to be
                aware of this and calculate accordingly.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>11. Play from both sides of the board</h2>
            <br>
            <p>The same principals and rules that you follow apply to your opponent as well. This means that you
                should
                always be aware of the options that your opponent possesses, especially on their side of the board.
                Always avoid tunnel vision when being aware of the board.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>12. Have a plan. Every move should have a purpose.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>When making a move make sure that the plan is sound. Try to avoid playing things such as one move
                threats
                or passive weakening moves. This is usually where mistakes are most commonly made, particularly in
                the
                opening.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>13. Assume your opponent's move is his best move / Always prioritize the best move while decision
                making.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Usually if your opponent makes moves based on principals, it will usually result in the best move.
                Anything else can result in punishable move which makes it better to focus on the best move for more
                necessary calculation.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>14. Ask yourself, "why did he move there?" after each opponent move / Understand the reasoning
                behind
                every move on the board from both players sides.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Every move as a reasoning, good and bad and understanding them can help you progress and even gain an
                advantage throughout a match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>15. Play for the initiative and controlling the board. / Play for an advantage and try to make the
                board
                work in your favor.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Try to make moves towards an ongoing advantage, identify imbalances and try to control the board with
                your pieces as much as possible in order to increase your winning odds.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>16. If you must lose a piece, get something for it if you can / If you lose a piece try your best to
                find compensation for it.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Don’t give up the moment that you lose a piece, keep fighting and make sure to minimize your
                opponents
                advantages to maintain a fighting chance through from gaining something in return such as a piece,
                or
                activity.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>17. When behind in material, exchange pawns. When ahead, exchange pieces.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Exchanging pieces while ahead in pawns allows for more potential of a promoted passed pawn in an
                endgame.
                Exchanging pawns while down in material will allow for less chance of promotion, ultimately
                increasing
                the drawing odds of a match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>18. If you are losing, don't give up fighting. Look for counterplay.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>There is often always counterplay if your opponent doesn’t play 100% accurately. Try to look for
                various
                threats or equalization in order to try and make a comeback within a match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>19. Don't play unsound moves unless you are losing badly.</h2>
            <p>If you REALLY lose hope on the board try something unorthodox to throw your opponent off and
                potentially
                get back into the game.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>20. Don't sacrifice a piece without good reason.</h2>
            <p>Don’t make miscalculated sacrifices, this will usually result in a loss of material and potentially
                the
                match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>21. If you are in doubt of an opponent's sacrifice, accept it / Punish poorly made sacrifices.</h2>
            <p>Don’t hesitate to punish a sacrifice if you believe that it doesn’t work.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>22. Attack with more than just one or two pieces / Principal of two Weaknesses.</h2>
            <p>When attacking, using more than one piece is typically required as the opponent also has many
                resources
                to defend with. This can also allow for more control over the opponents move responses giving more
                opportunity for an advantage.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>23. Do not make careless pawn moves, they cannot move back.</h2>
            <p>Aimlessly moving pawns can not only waste moves, they can develop a variety of weaknesses on the
                board
                such as overextended pawns, isolated pawns and potential weakening of the kingside.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>24. Do not block in bishops.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Blocking in bishops with pieces such as pawns can severely limit their activity within a match
                ultimately
                causing them to be ineffective throughout a match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>25. Bishops of opposite colors have the greatest chance of drawing.</h2>
            <p>Opposite colored bishops in an endgame can be difficult to convert into a win due to their poor
                ability
                to checkmate and inability to attack each other on opposite colored squares.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>26. Try not to move the same piece twice or more times in a row, especially in the opening.</h2>
            <p>Moving the same piece twice can typically result in a waste of moves, allowing your opponent to gain
                the
                upperhand by making more impactful moves.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>27. Exchange pieces if it helps your development.</h2>
            <p>If exchanging pieces will allow you more development without consequence, go for it.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>28. Don't bring your queen out early.</h2>
            <p>Bringing out your queen too early can result in her being vulnerable,
                allowing the opponent to gain move tempo’s and even potentially trapping your queen.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>29. Castle soon to protect your king and develop your rook.</h2>
            <p>Castling can allow for your rooks to get active within the game while simultaneously providing safety
                for
                your king.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>30. Develop rooks to open files.</h2>
            <p>Keeping rooks on open files will allow you more control over the board and in turn more options.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>31. Put rooks behind passed pawns.</h2>
            <p>Rooks behind passed pawns can support a pawn's journey to promotion.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>32. Double passed pawns can be stronger than a rook, even a queen.</h2>
            <p>Double passed pawn can support each other which can make stopping them even more difficult than just
                a
                singular passed pawn.
                This usually result in valuable material needing to be exchanged in order to prevent thier
                promotion.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>33. Study rook endgames. They are the most common and most complicated.</h2>
            <p>Rook endgames are very dynamic in turn decreasing the margin of error for both players to extract a
                win.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>34. Don't let your king get caught in the center.</h2>
            <p>A king in the center or an uncastled king can be extremely vulnerable allowing for more checks and
                even
                possible checkmate opportunities for an opponent.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>35. Don't castle if it brings your king into greater danger from attack.</h2>
            <p>Often, if a specific side of the board is being eyed down by an enemy's pieces while you lack proper
                defense in the area it is most likely a poor idea to try to castle into it.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>36. After castling, keep a good pawn formation around your king.</h2>
            <p>Try to maintain healthy pawn structures such as a wall of pawns, or an escape square for your king,
                this
                can provide better safety for your king.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>37. If your opponent only has one bishop try to put your pawns on the opposite of that bishop's
                color.
            </h2>
            <br>
            <p>Placing your pawns on the opposite color of an opponent's bishop can provide them better safety as
                the
                opposing bishop cannot attack them.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>38. Trade pawns pieces when ahead in material or when under attack.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Trading pieces when under attack can dampen the strength of an opponent's attack. Trading pieces when
                ahead in material can provide a player with a superior endgame.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>39. If in a cramped position, free your game by exchanging material.</h2>
            <p>Exchanging material while in a cramped position can allow for a more comfortable position,
                potentially
                equalizing the overall game.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>40. If your opponent is cramped, don't let him get any freeing exchanges.</h2>
            <p>Try to maintain control over the opponent's position as much as possible, don’t allow for positional
                equilibrium and try to maintain the advantage as much as possible.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>41. Study openings you are comfortable with.</h2>
            <p>Try working with openings that reason well with you, this can allow for better retention and more
                overall
                enjoyment within a match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>42. Play over entire games, not just the opening.</h2>
            <p>Understand the entirety of chess matches as they can always provide you with feedback on how to
                improve
                your game.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>43. Blitz chess is helpful in recognizing chess patterns. Play often.</h2>
            <p>Optional but try playing openings in blitz to improve opening intuition.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>44. Study annotated games and try to guess each move.</h2>
            <p>Try studying games and guessing the potential moves to assess calculation and move strength.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>45. Stick with just a few openings with White, and a few openings with Black.</h2>
            <p>When starting off, try learning and sticking with a few openings on both sides of the board. This
                will
                provide more options while playing games and more potential winning opportunities.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>46. Record your games and go over them, especially the games you lost.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>There is always something to learn from chess matches, won or lost, so try keeping track of games and
                receive as much feedback as possible to improve playing strength.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>47. Show your games to higher rated opponents and get feedback from them.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Learning from those who are more experienced than oneself can be a golden opportunity for
                improvement, If
                seeking growth don’t miss it.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>48. Use chess computers and databases to help you study and play more.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Truthfully when it comes to chess, computers will typically always win due to their consistent
                calculation and awareness skills. Use them to identify mistakes, understand moves, and even learn
                openings.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>49. Everyone blunders. The champions just blunder less often.</h2>
            Mistakes aren’t foreign to people, everyone is bound to them whether admitted or not. Therefore stay
            confident and keep advancing while learning from mistakes.
            <br>
            <h2>50. When it is not your move, look for tactics and combinations.</h2>
            <p>Identify potential opportunities on both sides of the board to develop some form of an advantage,
                Puzzles
                are highly recommended.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>51. Try to double rooks or double rook and queen on open files.</h2>
            <p>Doubling or even tripling rooks and queens on an open file can allow for very strong attacks against
                the
                opponent.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>52. Always ask yourself, "Does my next move overlook something simple?"</h2>
            <p>Don’t overlook things such as hanging pieces, king safety, or things that will cause a potential
                disadvantage to oneself.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>53. Don't make plans without the inclusion of the opponent's threats.</h2>
            <p>Both player in a chess match are equally capable, and don't neglect an opponent's options while
                preparing
                an attack. This can usually lead to mistakes and even a loss.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>54. Watch out for captures by retreat of an opponent's piece / Look out for discovered attacks.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Discovered attacks, especially in beginner chess can prove to be fatal, don’t miss them and allow a
                disadvantage.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>55. Do not focus on one sector of the board. View the whole board.</h2>
            <p>The entire board is important, maintaining vision over it at all times is crucial for a successful
                chess
                match.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>56. Try to solve chess puzzles with diagrams from books and magazines and even websites.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Websites such as <a href='https://lichess.org/' target='_blank'>Lichess.org</a> are great for
                practicing
                puzzles and building tactical recognition, do them often!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>57. It is less likely that an opponent is prepared for off-beat openings.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Openings such as the scandinavian and the english are great for throwing off opponents since they
                deviate
                from common principled play.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>58. Recognize transposition of moves from main-line play.</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Most openings are usually played by some studied line / variation, moves that deviate from these
                studied
                lines can usually result in mistakes or moves other than the best, making it important to understand
                where the mistake is in order to capitalize off of it.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>59. Watch your time and avoid time trouble / Try not to get flagged.</h2>
            <p>Truthfully it can be easy to lose on time if too much time is spent on thinking and making moves. The
                best option is to identify these weaknesses and try to strengthen through study and consistent play.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>60. Bishops are worth more than knights except when they are pinned in</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Bishops are typically better than knights, especially in the endgame where the board is more open due
                to
                their range. However, in closed positions where bishops are made inactive by pawns, knights are
                superior
                as they maintain activity on the board.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>61. Have confidence in your game.</h2>
            <p>Always play your best chess regardless of circumstances. Lack of confidence can often result in
                mistakes
                being made more frequently.</p>
            <br>
            <h2>62. Always play for a win.</h2>
            <p>Very straightforward, always play to win and checkmate that king!</p>
            <br>
            <h2>63. If you can’t win, play for a draw.</h2>
            <p>If you can’t win, don’t let your opponent win either, keep on fighting until you can become even with
                the
                opponent.</p>
